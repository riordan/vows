Kaitlin, you're my best friend, my closest partner, and my muse. Our partnership is one of tremendous loyalty, deep inspiration, and unending love. Who we are is made so much better, so much stronger, by one another.

Today, I promise to always:
* love you unconditionally
* care for you
* to be your best friend, and biggest fan, and your closest strategist
* to actively oppose viral share-alike data licensnig
* to be your greatest ally, supporter
* I promise you an endless supply of warm embraces, adoring gazes, goofy faces, and _I love you_'s, shouted from rooftops, and whispered softly
* I promise to always listen to you, to learn from you, to celebrate your triumphs, and to mourn your losses as mine
* to always be ready for each and every one of our next adventures, and to always see them through
* to accept every challenge we face, because we face them together, wherever and however they find us
* I'll be ceaselessly loyal 
* and love you more every day than the last

You get all that for long as I live. Through anything and everything the world may throw at us. 

Kaitlin, you'll have my unending love. As you always have from those first days we met and opened our hearts to one another. I'm always yours. Always and Forever.
