Dave, 

Today, I vow to stand with you, for you, and beside you for as long as we both shall live, forever in your corner as your best friend, your champion, your partner and your wife.

I promise to be true to you - to frustrate and challenge you, so that we never stop being curious or championing open access together. 

Being true to you in these ways are not just promises to me, they're my greatest job yet, and my greatest privilege. 

I vow to put our love first - and to put you (and now, Zev!) first - even when times get hard. That the love of those friends and family here today will continue to serve as a model, a support, and will get us through. I will be as steadfast as our love, your stability when life feels shaky and uncertain, and an everlasting reminder that regardless of what life throws at us, we got this. 

I believe in the trust of what we are - and who we are - and who we push each other to be. 

We spent so much time rushing to get to this moment, living as much life as possible. As one of our guests here today once said, now that we're here, all I now want is for this to slow down. Let me savor every moment just one moment longer. Let me capture all of the joy of each smile, of each impromptu dance party (whether of not anyone else is watching), of each morning, wrapped in your love. 

Here's to always taking that extra moment. May we never forget what a rare gift we have, may we never forget this feeling right now, and may we always work each and every day to feel like this, regardless of what tomorrow brings. May we always find a place for us, and be unafraid to adapt and evolve and grow. 

This is my ultimate MoU for ILU.
